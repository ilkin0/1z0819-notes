## Java-Building-Blocks

- **Object** is an instance of a class
- Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear the file.
- The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run
- A **variable** is a name for a piece of memory that stores data
- A **local variable** is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block
- An **instance variable**, often called a field, is a value defined within a specific instance of an object
- For **local variable type inference**, the compiler looks only at the line with the declaration. **var** only aviable for local variables inside a method body
- null value cannot be assigned to var, unless there's a casitng
  ```java
  var obj = null; //DOES NOT COMPILE
  var obj1 = (Object) null; //DOES COMPILE
  ```
- var variable must be initialized at the same line where declared

## Operators

- Smaller data types, namely, byte, short , and char , are first promoted to int any time they’re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int.
- Casting , between Objects, is allowed only if the underlying object is already a member of the class or interface.
