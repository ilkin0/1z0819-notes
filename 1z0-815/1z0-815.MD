## Java Building Blocks

- **Object** is an instance of a class
- Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear the file.
- The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run
- A **variable** is a name for a piece of memory that stores data
- A **local variable** is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block
- An **instance variable**, often called a field, is a value defined within a specific instance of an object
- For **local variable type inference**, the compiler looks only at the line with the declaration. **var** only aviable for local variables inside a method body
- null value cannot be assigned to var, unless there's a casitng:
  ```java
  var obj = null; //DOES NOT COMPILE
  var obj1 = (Object) null; //DOES COMPILE
  ```
- var variable must be initialized at the same line where declared

## Operators

- Smaller data types, namely, byte, short , and char , are first promoted to int any time they’re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int.

- Casting , between Objects, is allowed only if the underlying object is already a member of the class or interface.

- when using compound assignments operators, the compiler will automatically cast the resulting value to the data type of the value on the left side of the compound operator.

- Two references are equal if and only if they point to the same object or both point to null

## Making Decisions

- a **block of code** in Java is a group of zero or more statements
  between balanced braces ({}) and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed:

  ```java
  number++; // Single Statement

  {
      number++; //Statement inside a block
  }
  ```

### The strucutre of an else statement

![](src/images/the-structure-of-an-else-statement.PNG)

### The structure of a switch statement

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-switch-statement.PNG)

- a **switch** statement is not required to contain any **case** statements:

  ```java
  switch (fruit){} //Valid syntax
  ```

- boolean, long, float , and double are excluded from **switch
  statements**, as are their associated Boolean, Long, Float , and Double classes.

- A **loop** is a repetitive control structure that can execute a statement of code multiple times in succession.

### The Structure of a while statement

![](src/images/the-whlie-statement.PNG)

### The Structure of a do/while statement

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-dowhile-loop.PNG)

- a **do/while** loop purposely orders the body before the conditional expression so that the body will be executed at least once.

- An **infinite loop** is a loop whose termination condition is never reached during runtime.

### The Structure of a Basic For Loop

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-basic-for-loop.PNG)

- The variables in the **_initialization block_** must all be of the same type:

  ```java
  int x = 0;
  for(long y = 0, int z = 4; x < 5; x++) { // DOES NOT COMPILE
  System.out.print(y + " ");
  }
  ```

### The Structure of an Enhanced For-Each Loop

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-enhanced-foreach-loop.PNG)

- The right side of the for-each loop must be one of the following:

  - A built-in Java array
  - An object whose type implements java.lang.Iterable

- This does not include all of the Collections Framework classes or interfaces, but only those that implement or extend that **_Collection_** interface. For example, **_Map_** is not supported in a for-each loop, although **_Map_** does include methods that return Collection instances.

- The left side of the for-each loop must include a declaration for an instance of a variable whose type is compatible with the type of the array or collection on the right side of the statement.

## Core Java APIs

- A **_string_** is basically a sequence of characters.
- Placing one String before the other String and combining them is called string **_concatenation_**.
- **Immutability** - Once a **_String_** object is created, it is not allowed to change. It cannot be made larger or smaller, and you cannot change one of the characters inside it.
- **Immutable** classes in Java are final, which prevents subclasses creation.
- A **string** is a sequence of characters and Java counts from 0 when indexed.

  - ### Indexing for a string
    ![](src/images/indexing-for-a-string.png)

- When determining the total size or length, Java uses normal counting again:
  ```java
    String string = "animals";
    System.out.println(string.length()); // 7
  ```
- **indexOf()** method returns –1 when no match is found:
  ```java
    String string = "animals";
    System.out.println(string.indexOf('a', 4)); // 4
    System.out.println(string.indexOf("al", 5)); // -1
  ```
- In the **substring()** method **endIndex** parameter is allowed to be 1 past the end of the sequence if you want to stop at the end of the sequence.
  - ### Indexses for a substirng
    ![](src/images/indexses-for-a-substring.png)
- **substring()** methods parametehrs **String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)**. beginIndex is inclusive. However endIndex is exclusive:
  ```java
  String string = "animals";
  System.out.println(string.substring(3, 7)); // mals
  ```
- The **_equals()_** method checks whether two String objects contain exactly the same characters in the same order. The **_equalsIgnoreCase()_** method checks whether two String objects contain the same characters with the exception that it will convert the characters’ case if needed:
  ```java
  System.out.println("abc".equals("ABC")); // false
  System.out.println("ABC".equals("ABC")); // true
  System.out.println("abc".equalsIgnoreCase("ABC")); // true
  ```
- The **_strip()_** method is new in Java 11. It does everything that **_trim()_** does, but it supports Unicode.
- The **_intern()_** method returns the value from the string pool if it is there. Otherwise, it adds the value to the string pool.
- Unlike the **_String_** class, **_StringBuilder_** is not immutable.
- **StringBuffer** works the same way as **_StringBuilder_** except it supports threads(threadsafe).
- **_StringBuffer_** is no longer on either exam. It performs slower than **StringBuilder**.
- The **_delete()_** method is more flexible than some others when it comes to array indexes. If you specify a second parameter that is past the end of the StringBuilder, Java will just assume you meant the end. That means this code is legal:
  ```java
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("abcdef");
  sb.delete(1, 100); // sb = a
  ```
- **_equals_** method check the values inside the String rather than the string reference itself. If a class doesn’t have an equals method, Java determines whether the references point to the same object—which is exactly what **==** does.
- **==** is checking for object reference equality.
- The **string pool**, also known as the **intern pool**, is a location in the Java virtual machine (JVM) that collects all these strings.
- The **_JVM_** created only **one** literal in memory.
- Never use intern() or == to compare String objects in your code.
- This approach is called an anonymous array. It is anonymous because you don’t specify the type and size:
  ```java
  int[] numbers2 = {42, 55, 99};
  ```
- Just like a **StringBuilder**, an **ArrayList** can change capacity at runtime as needed. Like an **_array_**, an **ArrayList** is an ordered sequence that allows duplicates.
- **_ArrayList_** implements an interface called **List**. In other words, an **_ArrayList is a List_**.
- The **valueOf()** allows object caching. The wrapper classes are immutable and take advantage of some caching as well. The **valueOf()** returns Wrapper class (Integer, Double, etc.). **Parse** methods (**_parseInt()_** etc.) return a primitive,
  and the **_valueOf()_** method returns a wrapper class.
- **Arrays.asList(array)** point to the same data store **_array_**. Change in **Arrays.asList(array)** will affect **_array_** directly and vice verse.
- **_Array.asList()_** cannot change size.
- **_List.of(array)_** create immutable list. Have not any realtion with original **_array_**.
- ### Array and List conversions
  ![](src/images/array-and-list-conversions.png)
- Calling == on **_String_** objects will check whether they point to the same object in the pool. Calling == on **_StringBuilder_** references will check whether they are pointing to the same StringBuilder object. Calling equals() on **_String_** objects will check whether the
  sequence of characters is the same. Calling equals() on StringBuilder objects will check whether they are pointing to the same object rather than looking at the values inside.
- Understand the difference between == and equals(). == checks object equality.
  equals() depends on the implementation of the object it is being called on. For Strings, equals() checks the characters inside of it.

## Lambdas and Functional Interfaces

- **_Deferred execution_** means that code is specified now but will run later.
- **Lambdas** work with interfaces that have only one abstract method. These are called **_functional interfaces_**.
- These two lines do the exact same thing:
  ```java
  a -> a.canHop()
  (Animal a) -> { return a.canHop(); }
  ```
- The parentheses can be omitted only if there is a single parameter and its type is not explicitly stated.
- **Java** doesn’t require you to type return or use a semicolon when no braces are used.
- **_Lambda_** can access an instance variable, method parameter, or local variable under certain conditions. Instance variables (and class variables) are always allowed.
- Method parameters and local variables are allowed to be referenced if they are **_effectively final_**.
- A **functional interface** is one with a single abstract method.

## Mehtods and Encapsulation

- Order of modifiers, descenidng:
  - public < protected < package (or default) < private
- Java will create an empty array if no parameters are passed for a **_vararg_**.
- **Private** - The **_private_** modifier means the method can be called only from within the same class.
- **Default (Package-Private) Access** - With default access, private plus other classes in the same package
- **Protected** - The **_protected_** modifier means the method can be called only from classes in the same package or subclasses.
- **Public** - The **_public_** modifier means the method can be called from any class.
- In addition to **_main()_** methods, static methods have two main purposes:
- For utility or helper methods that don’t require any object state. Since there is no need to access instance variables, having static methods eliminates the need for the caller to instantiate an object just to call the method.
- For state that is shared by all instances of a class. All instances must share the same state. Methods that merely use that state should be static as well.
- You can use an instance of the object to call a **_static_** method.

```java
public static int count = 0; // static variable
5: Koala k = new Koala();
6: System.out.println(k.count); // k is a Koala
7: k = null;
8: System.out.println(k.count); // k is still a Koala, VALID
```

- A static member cannot call an instance member without referencing an instance of the class.
- Static methods/variables cannot call instance methods/variables, and vice verse.
- Regular imports are for importing classes. **_Static imports_** are for importing static members of classes.
- Java uses **_pass-by-value_** to get data into a method.
- **_Method overloading_** occurs when methods have the same name but different method signatures. Everything other than the method name can vary for overloading methods.
- Java has a concept called type erasure where generics are used only at compile time.
- Encapsulation means only methods in the class with the variables can refer to the instance variables.
- Accessor method = getter, Mutator method = setter.
- Java uses pass-by-value, which means that calls to methods create a copy of the parameters. Assigning new values to those parameters in the method doesn’t affect the caller’s variables.

## Class Design

- Inheritance is the process by which a subclass automatically includes any public or protected members of the class, including primitives, objects, or methods, defined in the parent class.
- Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance in the language.
- It is possible in Java to prevent a class from being extended by marking the class with the **_final modifier_**.
- A concrete class is a class that has an implementation for all of its methods that were inherited from abstract or implemented via interfaces.
- In Java, a top-level class is a class that is not defi ned inside another class.
- If you call **_this()_**, the this() call must be the first statement in the constructor.
- **this**, refers to an instance of the class, while , **this()**, refers to a constructor call within the class.
- **super**, is used to reference members of the parent class, while, **super()**, calls a parent constructor.
- Unlike **local final variables**, which are not required to have a value unless they are actually used, **_final instance variables must be assigned a value_**.
- **Class Initialization:**
  1. If there is a superclass Y of X, then initialize class Y first
  2. Process all static variable declarations in the order they appear in the class.
  3. Process all static initializers in the order they appear in the class.
- A class must be initialized before it is referenced or used.
- **Initialize Instance of X:**
  1. If there is a superclass Y of X, then initialize the instance of Y first.
  2. Process all instance variable declarations in the order they appear in the class.
  3. Process all instance initializers in the order they appear in the class.
  4. Initialize the constructor including any overloaded constructors referenced with this().
- Constructor Rules:
  1. The first statement of every constructor is a call to an overloaded constructor via this() , or a direct parent constructor via super().
  2. If the first statement of a constructor is not a call to this() or super() , then the compiler will insert a no-argument super() as the first statement of the constructor.
  3. Calling this() and super() after the first statement of a constructor results in a compiler error.
  4. If the parent class doesn’t have a no-argument constructor, then every constructor in the child class must start with an explicit this() or super() constructor call.
  5. If the parent class doesn’t have a no-argument constructor and the child doesn’t define any constructors, then the child class will not compile.
  6. If a class only defines private constructors, then it cannot be extended by a top-level class.
  7. All final instance variables must be assigned a value exactly once by the end of the
     constructor. Any final instance variables not assigned a value will be reported as a compiler error on the line the constructor is declared.
- In Java, **overriding** a method occurs when a subclass declares a new implementation for an inherited method with the same signature and compatible return type.
- Override a method:
  1. The method in the child class must have the same signature as the method in the parent class.
  2. The method in the child class must be at least as accessible as the method in the parent class.
  3. The method in the child class may not declare a checked exception that is new or broader than the class of any exception declared in the parent class method.
  4. If the method returns a value, it must be the same or a subtype of the method in the parent class, known as **_covariant return types_**.
- A **_subtype_** is the relationship between two types where one type inherits the other.
- Likewise, a **_supertype_** is the reciprocal relationship between two types where one type is the ancestor of the other.
- Generic methods cannot be overloaded by changing the generic parameter type only.
- A hidden method occurs when a child class defines a static method with the same name and signature as an inherited static method defined in a parent class.
- The previous four rules for overriding a method must be followed when a method is hidden. In addition, a new rule is added for hiding a method: 5. The method defined in the child class must be marked as static if it is marked as:
  static in a parent class.
- By marking a method **final**, you forbid a child class from replacing this method.
- A hidden variable occurs when a child class defines a variable with the same name as an inherited variable defined in the parent class.
- You can’t override a variable.
- Object and Reference:
  1. The type of the object determines which properties exist within the object in memory.
  2. The type of the reference to the object determines which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program.
- Casting Objects:
  1. Casting a reference from a subtype to a supertype doesn’t require an explicit cast.
  2. Casting a reference from a supertype to a subtype requires an explicit cast.
  3. The compiler disallows casts to an unrelated class.
  4. At runtime, an invalid cast of a reference to an unrelated type results in a ClassCastException being thrown.
- Just as the compiler does not allow casting an object to unrelated types, it also does not allow **_instanceof_** to be used with unrelated types.
- Classes are initialized in a predetermined order: superclass initialization; static variables and static initializers in the order that they appear; instance variables and instance initializers in the order they appear; and finally, the constructor. All final instance vari ables must be assigned a value exactly once. If by the time a constructor finishes, a final instance variable is not assigned a value, then the constructor will not compile.
