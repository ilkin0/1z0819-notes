## Java Building Blocks

- **Object** is an instance of a class
- Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear the file.
- The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run
- A **variable** is a name for a piece of memory that stores data
- A **local variable** is a variable defined within a constructor, method, or initializer block
- An **instance variable**, often called a field, is a value defined within a specific instance of an object
- For **local variable type inference**, the compiler looks only at the line with the declaration. **var** only aviable for local variables inside a method body
- null value cannot be assigned to var, unless there's a casitng
  ```java
  var obj = null; //DOES NOT COMPILE
  var obj1 = (Object) null; //DOES COMPILE
  ```
- var variable must be initialized at the same line where declared

## Operators

- Smaller data types, namely, byte, short , and char , are first promoted to int any time they’re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int.

- Casting , between Objects, is allowed only if the underlying object is already a member of the class or interface.

- when using compound assignments operators, the compiler will automatically cast the resulting value to the data type of the value on the left side of the compound operator.

- Two references are equal if and only if they point to the same object or both point to null

## Making Decisions

- a **block of code** in Java is a group of zero or more statements
  between balanced braces ({}) and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.

```java
number++; // Single Statement

{
    number++; //Statement inside a block
}
```

### The structure of a switch statement

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-switch-statement.PNG)

- a **switch** statement is not required to contain any **case** statements.

```java
switch (fruit){} //Valid syntax
```

- boolean, long, float , and double are excluded from **switch
  statements**, as are their associated Boolean, Long, Float , and Double classes.

- A **loop** is a repetitive control structure that can execute a statement of code multiple times in succession.

### The Structure of a while statement

### The Structure of a do/while statement

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-dowhile-loop.PNG)

- a **do/while** loop purposely orders the body before the conditional expression so that the body will be executed at least once.

- An **infinite loop** is a loop whose termination condition is never reached during runtime.

### The Structure of a Basic For Loop

![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-basic-for-loop.PNG)

- The variables in the **_initialization block_** must all be of the same type.

```java
int x = 0;
for(long y = 0, int z = 4; x < 5; x++) { // DOES NOT COMPILE
 System.out.print(y + " ");
}
```
### The Structure of an Enhanced For-Each Loop
![](src/images/the-structure-of-a-enhanced-foreach-loop.PNG)

- The right side of the for-each loop must be one of the following:
  - A built-in Java array
  - An object whose type implements java.lang.Iterable

- This does not include all of the Collections Framework classes or interfaces, but only those that implement or extend that ***Collection*** interface. For example, ***Map*** is not supported in a for-each loop, although ***Map*** does include methods that return Collection instances.

- The left side of the for-each loop must include a declaration for an instance of a variable whose type is compatible with the type of the array or collection on the right side of the statement.
